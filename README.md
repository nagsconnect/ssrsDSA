#### Stack
* push
* pop
#### Monotonically Increasing/decreasing stack
#### Queue
* offer
* poll

### Tree
#### Binary Tree
* Insertion

* search

#### Binary Search Tree
#### Self Balancing Tree
* AVL 
* B Tree
* B+
* Red-Black

#### Segment Tree
* range queries

### Graph
Graph has nodes/vertices and these are connected by edges. Each of them has been represented in objects named Node, Edge as part of representing to work around.
To note here, a graph can be represented as
* Adjacency Matrix
* Adjacency List or Weighted Adjacency List (update to have single representation for weighted or unweighted)
* Nodes (here only nodes will be known, so graph can't be formed from this just used for all nodes in a graph)
* Edges

#### Traversal
* Breadth First Search(BFS)
* Depth First Search(DFS)

#### Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
* Kruskal
* Prim

#### Shortest Path
* Dijkstra
* Bellman-Ford
* Floyd-Warshall
* ShortestPathInAGrid
* ShortestPathUsingBFS

#### Union-Find 
Below are the variations of Disjoint Set/Union-Find data structure, the variations come across time complexities in particular to find or union operations
* QuickFind
* QuickUnion
* UnionFind by path compression and ranking

#### Topological Sort
* Kahn (uses BFS)
* Using DFS

#### Articulation Points and Bridges
* Tarjan
  
#### Miscellaneous 
* Detect Cycle in a graph
* All paths between any two nodes
* number of connected components (in graph)
